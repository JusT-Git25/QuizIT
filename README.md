# 🚀 QuizIT

> A customizable MCQ training platform built to optimize studying through active recall and explanation-driven learning.

QuizIT allows users to upload:

* 📄 A file containing **multiple-choice questions**
* 📘 A file containing **answers + explanations**

The system then generates an interactive quiz experience with feedback, scoring, and explanation review — all designed to improve retention and understanding.

## 🎯 Motivation

While many quiz platforms exist, QuizIT was built to:

* 🧠 Prioritize **learning**, not just scoring
* 📚 Separate questions from explanations for better content control
* ⚙️ Allow full customization of quiz behavior
* 🏗 Serve as a hands-on project to practice system design and implementation

This project was created as part of improving study techniques and building practical software engineering skills.

2. System:

   * Parses both files
   * Matches question IDs
   * Stores structured quiz data

3. During quiz:

   * User selects an answer
   * Immediate feedback is provided
   * Explanation is shown
   * Score updates dynamically
